          <p>Gráig na Manach, meaning "Village of the Monks" is considered to be one of the most beautiful areas in the southeast of Ireland. It is located on the <a href="riverbarrow.php">River Barrow</a> at the foot of <a href="brandonhill.php">Brandon Hill</a>. It is home to <a href="duiskeabbey.php">Duiske Abbey</a>, the largest and perhaps the finest of the thirty-four medieval Cistercian abbeys in Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>Graiguenamanagh expanded beyond the Abbey as a market town, aided by the development of the Grand Canal and the navigation of the <a href="riverbarrow.php">River Barrow</a>, which ultimately connected the town with Dublin, New Ross, Waterford and Carlow. The production of wool was historically important to the town’s economy and sheep rearing remains a predominant agricultural activity in the hinterland.</p>
